'''
The fountains mingle with the river,
And the rivers with the ocean; 
The winds of heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion; 
Nothing in the world is single; 
All things by a law divine
In another's being mingle- 
Why not I with thine? 

See, the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another; 
No sister flower could be forgiven
If it disdained its brother; 
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea; - 
What are all these kissings worth,
If thou kiss not me?
